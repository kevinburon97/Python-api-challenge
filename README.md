# Weather-near-Equator

In this project, I use an API from OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data. This data is analyzed and visualized using pandas and matplotlib to demonstrate what
happens to the weather as we near the Equator. As one may be able to predict, the temperature gets hotter as we approach the equator. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a correlation between latitude, and cloudiness and wind speed. The next step was to create an ideal weather range and find hotels where one could vacation. In order to do so, i used an API from google to find hotels in the nearby area of cities that fit in the criteria of ideal weather.
